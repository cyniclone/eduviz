# eduviz

### Purpose
In addition to a visualization, eduviz is also a project of substantial data handling. This repository serves to show all steps in the process and serve as a de-facto tutorial for data analysis.

With an immense, "non-trivial" dataset, it is worthwhile to be exacting and meticulous in one's data parsing process. Each numbered folder will show progression of the data and explain the transformations that are occurring, as well as the tools used.
