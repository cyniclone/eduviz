# eduviz

### Purpose
In addition to a visualization, eduviz is also a project of substantial data handling. This repository serves to show all steps in the process and serve as a de-facto tutorial for data analysis. The dataset in question is from [The US Department of Education](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/)

With an immense, "non-trivial" dataset, it is worthwhile to be exacting and meticulous in one's data parsing process. Each numbered folder will show progression of the data and explain the transformations that are occurring, as well as the tools used.

<b>Please note</b> that the actual .csv files are not present in this repository due to GitHub's filesize limits.

### data-map
The data-map contains a more apt description of the tools used as well as a profile of the data.
See the data-map [here](data-map.md)

### tutorial
Tutorials are in the form of the .ipynb notebooks, see [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) for more information on iPython notebooks. This is done with the intent of having full visibility of scripting and file/data manipulation.
